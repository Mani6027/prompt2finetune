        "\n",
        "**What it is:** Zero-shot prompting involves giving the model a task without providing any examples or demonstrations. The model relies entirely on its pre-training knowledge to understand and complete the task. This is the most basic form of prompting where you simply describe what you want the model to do.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use:** Zero-shot prompting works best for simple, well-defined tasks where the model has strong general knowledge from its training data. It's ideal when you need quick results without spending time on prompt engineering or when dealing with common tasks like basic summarization, translation, or simple Q&A.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros:** The main advantages include quick setup with minimal token usage, straightforward implementation that doesn't require example selection, and fast execution since there's only one API call. It's also very flexible and can handle a wide variety of tasks without modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:** The primary limitations are less reliable performance on complex or domain-specific tasks, inconsistent output format that may require post-processing, and lower accuracy compared to more sophisticated prompting strategies. The model may also produce unexpected results if the task is ambiguous.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Best for:** Common tasks like basic summarization, translation, simple Q&A, general knowledge questions, and straightforward text processing. It works particularly well when the task is clearly defined and the model has strong prior knowledge about the domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** Zero-shot prompting works best with clear, unambiguous instructions. The quality of results depends heavily on how well you can describe the task in natural language.\n"

Some found the vacuum heavy, noisy, or awkward to use, with problems like small dustbins, loose attachments, and motor noise. While a few consider it a reliable, simple, and effective option for basic cleaning, others view it as overpriced and disappointing, especially given its battery and durability problems.

        "\n",
        "**What it is:** Few-shot prompting involves providing the model with 2-5 example input-output pairs before asking it to complete a similar task. These examples serve as demonstrations that guide the model's behavior and help it understand the expected format, style, and approach for the specific task.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use:** Few-shot prompting is ideal when you need specific output format or style, working with domain-specific patterns, or when the model needs guidance on how to approach a particular type of task. It's particularly effective when you have representative examples that clearly show the desired input-output relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros:** The main advantages include better accuracy and consistency compared to zero-shot, helps the model understand exact requirements through concrete examples, and provides more reliable output formatting. It's also relatively simple to implement and doesn't require extensive prompt engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:** The primary limitations include higher token usage due to the included examples, requires careful selection of representative examples, and the quality of results depends heavily on the relevance and quality of the provided examples. Poor examples can actually hurt performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Best for:** Formatting tasks, classification problems, domain-specific outputs, maintaining consistent tone or style, and tasks where the pattern is clear but the model needs specific guidance. It works well for tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and structured data extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** The quality and relevance of examples directly impact results. Choose examples that are representative of the task and clearly demonstrate the desired input-output relationship. Avoid examples that are too similar to each other or that might confuse the model.\n"

        "**Cons:** The primary limitations include multiple API calls making it more expensive, slower execution time due to the iterative nature, and higher token usage.

Many users appreciate the cordless design and find it reliable for everyday cleaning, with some noting premium build quality and efficient motor performance. Negative points commonly cited are inconsistent and often poor battery life, especially over time, a small dustbin capacity, occasional attachment issues, higher noise levels than expected, and difficulties with deep-pile carpets or heavy-duty cleaning. Some users report the vacuum being heavy or awkward, disappointing durability, and inadequate customer service. Overall, the product is seen as good for light to moderate cleaning but has notable limitations that affect satisfaction for larger or\n",

        "\n",
        "**What it is:** Meta prompting assigns the model an explicit role with structured instructions and specific output format requirements. It's like giving the model a job description and clear guidelines on how to perform that job, ensuring consistent behavior across interactions and adherence to specific requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use:** Meta prompting is most effective when you need consistent behavior across multiple interactions, have complex task requirements, or are building production systems where reliability and consistency are crucial. It's ideal for API integrations, automated systems, and any situation where the model needs to maintain a specific persona or approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros:** The main advantages include clear expectations that lead to more consistent outputs, improved task adherence through explicit role definition, better output formatting through structured instructions, and the ability to fine-tune behavior for specific use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:** The primary limitations include the need for careful prompt engineering to define roles effectively, potential over-constraint that might limit creativity, and the requirement to test and refine role definitions for optimal performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Best for:** Production systems, API integrations, specific output formats, role-based tasks, and any situation where consistency and reliability are more important than creativity. It works particularly well when combined with other strategies for production use.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** Meta prompting works best when the role definition is clear and specific. The quality of results depends heavily on how well you can articulate the desired behavior and output format. It's often most effective when combined with other prompting strategies.\n"
